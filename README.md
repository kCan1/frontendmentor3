## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom properties)
- Tailwind CSS
- React (functional components)
- Vite (build tool)
- Flexbox & CSS Grid for layout
- Responsive units (rem, em, %, clamp)

### What I Learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Managing component state and props in React
- Implementing accessible and interactive UI elements
- Using Vite for fast React development
- Improving semantic layout for better accessibility and structure

#### Challenges & Solutions

I found it challenging to get the text sizes right and make them responsive across different devices. Adjusting font sizes and ensuring good readability on both mobile and desktop required extra effort and experimentation. I tried using the CSS `clamp()` function for font sizing, which turned out to be quite useful for achieving fluid and responsive typography.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Explore advanced accessibility features
- Improve animation and transition effects
- Refine component reusability and modularity
- Further enhance semantic HTML structure
